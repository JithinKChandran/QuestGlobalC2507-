  
**SOLID Principles: A Deep Dive**

The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that guide software developers to create maintainable, flexible, and understandable code. By adhering to these principles, you can build robust and scalable software systems.

**1\. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**

* **Definition:** A class should have only one reason to change.  
* **Explanation:** This principle emphasizes that a class should have a single, well-defined responsibility. By keeping classes focused on a single task, you make them easier to understand, test, and maintain.  
* **Example:** Consider a User class that handles both user data and database operations:  
  C\#  
  `public class User`  
  `{`  
      `public string Name { get; set; }`  
      `public string Email { get; set; }`

      `public void SaveToDatabase()`  
      `{`  
          `// Database operations`  
      `}`  
  `}`

  This violates SRP. A better approach is to separate concerns:  
  C\#  
  `public class User`  
  `{`  
      `public string Name { get; set; }`  
      `public string Email { get; set; }`  
  `}`

  `public class UserRepository`  
  `{`  
      `public void Save(User user)`  
      `{`  
          `// Database operations`  
      `}`  
  `}`

**2\. Open-Closed Principle (OCP):**

* **Definition:** Entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.  
* **Explanation:** This principle suggests that you should be able to add new functionality to a system without modifying existing code. This is achieved through inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces.  
* **Example:** Consider a Shape class hierarchy:  
  C\#  
  `public abstract class Shape`  
  `{`  
      `public abstract double Area();`  
  `}`

  `public class Circle : Shape`  
  `{`  
      `// ...`  
  `}`

  `public class Rectangle : Shape`  
  `{`  
      `// ...`  
  `}`

  To add a new shape like Triangle, you can create a new class that inherits from Shape without touching the existing Circle and Rectangle classes.

**3\. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**

* **Definition:** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.  
* **Explanation:** This principle ensures that subclasses can be substituted for their superclasses without causing unexpected behavior.  
* **Example:** Consider a Bird class and its subclasses FlyingBird and NonFlyingBird:  
  C\#  
  `public abstract class Bird`  
  `{`  
      `public abstract void Fly();`  
  `}`

  `public class FlyingBird : Bird`  
  `{`  
      `public override void Fly()`  
      `{`  
        `// ...`  
      `}`  
  `}`

  `public class NonFlyingBird : Bird`  
  `{`  
      `public override void Fly()`  
      `{`  
          `throw new NotImplementedException();`  
      `}`  
  `}`

  Here, NonFlyingBird violates LSP because it cannot be substituted for FlyingBird without breaking the application. A better approach might be to have a separate Flying interface.

**4\. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**

* **Definition:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.  
* **Explanation:** This principle suggests that interfaces should be small and focused. Large, monolithic interfaces can lead to tight coupling and unnecessary complexity.  
* **Example:** Consider a Printer interface with Print, Scan, and Fax methods:  
  C\#  
  `public interface IPrinter`  
  `{`  
      `void Print();`  
      `void Scan();`  
      `void Fax();`  
  `}`

  A SimplePrinter that only supports printing would have to implement unnecessary Scan and Fax methods. A better approach is to break down the interface into smaller, more specific interfaces:  
  C\#  
  `public interface IPrinter`  
  `{`  
      `void Print();`  
  `}`

  `public interface IScanner`  
  `{`  
      `void Scan();`  
  `}`

**5\. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**

* **Definition:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.  
* **Explanation:** This principle promotes loose coupling between modules by introducing abstraction layers. It helps to make code more modular, testable, and maintainable.  
* **Example:** Consider a UserService that directly depends on a Database class:  
  C\#  
  `public class UserService`  
  `{`  
      `private Database _database;`

      `public void SaveUser(User user)`  
      `{`  
          `_database.Save(user);`  
      `}`  
  `}`

  This tightly couples the UserService to the Database class. A better approach is to introduce an abstraction layer:  
  C\#  
  `public interface IUserRepository`  
  `{`  
      `void Save(User user);`  
  `}`

  `public class DatabaseUserRepository : IUserRepository`  
  `{`  
      `// ...`  
  `}`

  `public class UserService`  
  `{`  
      `private IUserRepository _userRepository;`

      `public UserService(IUserRepository userRepository)`  
      `{`  
          `_userRepository = userRepository;`  
      `}`

      `public void SaveUser(User user)`  
      `{`  
          `_userRepository.Save(user);`  
      `}`  
  `}`
